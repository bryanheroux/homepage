Mission Statement

Our goal is to help our clients add value to their homes and lives.  Through custom home building or renovations we strive to help our clients maximize the value of their investment by providing affordable project management alongside high level finishing.  Whether you are building your dream craftsmen style home or re-inventing a space in a contemporary or modern style, Heroux Homes is your best choice.

Custom Home Building
We rely on years of experience from an excellent team of trades and craftsmen to execute any custom home design.  By working with our affiliated architects and designers your ideas become reality.

Renovations
Often the best investment is updating your existing home.  If you love your neighbourhood and home but would like higher quality finishes and a greater level of comfort then let's renovate!  With the inherent value of your home to build on, we can help re-design and re-invent your dated home.  Whether is a cosmetic upgrade, knocking down some walls, or a total re-structuring, high quality renovations is what we do best.
