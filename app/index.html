              <p>
                Often the best investment is updating your existing home.  If you love your neighbourhood and home but would like

                to build on, we can help re-design and re-invent your dated home.  Whether is a cosmetic upgrade, knocking down
                some walls, or a total re-structuring, high quality renovations is what we do best.

              <p>I would (and regularly do) recommend Heroux Homes to everyone I meet.
                Bryan's commitment to excellence, coupled with his knowledge, integrity and honesty, make him and his crew a complete pleasure to work with.
                With Heroux Homes you never have to worry about being left in the lurch and he stands behind his work 100%.

              <p>
                I would highly recommend Heroux Contracting. Bryan’s attention to detail is second to none.
                I have used Bryan for numerous jobs around my house and I can count on it being completed on time and on budget.
                And to the highest of quality. My experience with other contractors has been they show up when it is good for them and complete the job in the same manner – when it suits them.
                Bryan will call you should he running late or if there is any issue.
                Keeps you informed along the way no matter what – this is what is frustrating with most contractors – you have no idea what is going on – not with Bryan – always well informed.

                Bryan has done work in the past & we find him to be punctual, knowledgeable, well qualified and explains it simply.
                Quotes on the job & sticks to his quote. Follow up is important to Bryan & us.
                They are a company with integrity & I recommend Heroux Homes without hesitation.
