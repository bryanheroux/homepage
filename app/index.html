              <p>I would (and regularly do) recommend Heroux Homes to everyone I meet.
                Bryan's commitment to excellence, coupled with his knowledge, integrity and honesty, make him and his crew a complete pleasure to work with.
                With Heroux Homes you never have to worry about being left in the lurch and he stands behind his work 100%.
                When taking on any construction project, Heroux Homes provides the piece of mind that is a rare treasure to find in this industry!</p>

                I would highly recommend Heroux Contracting. Bryan’s attention to detail is second to none.
                I have used Bryan for numerous jobs around my house and I can count on it being completed on time and on budget.
                And to the highest of quality. My experience with other contractors has been they show up when it is good for them and complete the job in the same manner – when it suits them.
                Bryan will call you should he be running late or if there is any issue.
                Keeps you informed along the way no matter what – this is what is frustrating with most contractors – you have no idea what is going on – not with Bryan – always well informed.

                If we have a problem or need new construction done, Heroux Homes is our first and last call.
                Bryan has done work for us in the past and we find him to be punctual, knowledgeable, well qualified and explains it simply.
                Quotes on the job and sticks to his quote. Follow up is important to Bryan and us.
                They are a company with integrity and I recommend Heroux Homes without hesitation.

                It has been a pleasure having your crew doing our reno, even though we seem prone to various hickups, your work ethic and workmanship is excellent, not to mention your trade skills. I would not hesitate to recommend you to anyone wanting renos done.
